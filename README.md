### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Student, with no set goal for now.  
I haven't picked particular field of work to go into in the future.
Currently I am equally interested in Python, C#. Potential Android Development (Kotlin, maybe Flutter/Dart but not sure).
I am also interested in web development due to low entry level.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I am only a beginner, so I am not accepting any collaboration or job proposals. Thank you.
